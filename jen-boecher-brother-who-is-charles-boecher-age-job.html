However, they have one problem: Rishi’s parents in India have no idea about his relationship with Jen. Several of Jen and Rishi’s family members make their appearances in 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way Season 4 and Jennifer’s brother, Charles Boecher, is one of them.</p><p>Read the article below to learn more about 90 Day Fiance star Jen Boecher’s brother.</p><h3><strong>Meet Charles Boecher, 90 Day Fiance Star Jen Boecher Brother</strong></h3><p>On February 3, 2023, Jen uploaded a clip on her Instagram <a href=#>@jen_90day</a>, where she could be seen visiting her brother’s farm Zion Oaks in Stillwell, Oklahoma. That IG post confirmed Charles’ appearance on 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way Season 4.</p><p>Three days later, Jennifer again shared a meme from the 90 Day Fiance News & Memes FB group made on Charles. In the caption, she wrote, “So proud of my brother with everything he and Tarra have done with their American Wagyu business & his winning the county commissioner election. He even has his own meme now! Also? Randomly, at least 420 people like it.”</p><p>90 Day Fiance star Jen works as a content creator and enjoys traveling. Jen, who was 46 at the time of filming, describes herself as a nomad and hates settling down from a young age. Since birth, she has lived in about 5 or 6 major cities.</p><p>Jen met Rishi while she was on her solo trip to India. She was passing by her hotel’s lobby when she noticed Rishi, who was there for a modeling gig. In their first conversation, Jen did not consider Rishi the type of person she would fall for. However, Rishi convinced her to hang out with him later that week, where she got to know the real him. It was that moment when Jen felt Rishi was meant for her.</p><p>One month after they started dating, Rishi proposed and Jen was over the moon to accept. Although Jen had to return to the US due to her visa restrictions, the reality TV star returned to India to marry her beloved.</p><p>Jen has had her fair share of heartbreaks in the past. Despite that, she felt confident about opening herself to Rishi. She was even ready to settle in India to live together with Rishi.</p><p>Although it looked like Jen and Rishi will be together for the rest of their life, their relationship had its first major hiccup when Jen learned that Rishi’s parents did not know about their relationship. On top of that, she also found out that Rishi’s parents were looking for a bride and would likely want him to have an arranged marriage with someone in their caste. Naturally, this created a rift between the two.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we did not know if the two were still together.</p><h3><strong>Charles Boecher Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1979, Charles Boecher’s age was 43 as of February 2023.</p><h3><strong>Charles Boecher Job</strong></h3><p>Coming to Charles Boecher’s job details, his Facebook profile showed that he was a former senior intelligence analyst at US Army.
