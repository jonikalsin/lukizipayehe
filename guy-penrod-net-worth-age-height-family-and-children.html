He was born on the 2nd of July 1963 in Abilene, Texas, United States, but his family later relocated to Hobbs, New Mexico, where he spent a better part of his formative years. He is obviously an American by nationality, but ethnicity-wise, he is said to be White. Penrod currently lives in Nashville, Tennessee in the US.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The musician’s full name is Guy Allen Penrod, and he is the son of Rev. Joseph Loren “Joe” Penrod, a reverend gentleman who pastored Temple Baptist Church. On the other hand, his mum is Barbara Gray Penrod, but the details of her professional life are unknown.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The only grey area in Guy Penrod’s early life is information about his siblings. However, many have speculated that he may be an only child, but this is yet to be confirmed.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Talking about his academic journey, Guy passed through Hobbs High School. His days as a high school student were quite memorable, as that was when he created his debut album. After graduation, he joined Liberty University for further studies.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Tall Is Guy Penrod?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Guy Penrod has a gigantic height; the American artist measures 6 feet 2 inches in height, which is the same as 187 centimeters.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Penrod weighs 89 kg or 198 pounds in body mass. He has light brown eyes and blond hair, which he constantly wears long.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Is Guy Penrod’s Wife?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Guy Penrod is a married man, and his wife is an American woman called Angie Clark. The couple met during their days as students of Liberty University and went on to date for three years before Penrod popped the big question to his love interest.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The duo scheduled their wedding in 1985 on the exact day that Guy became a college graduate. Their wedding ceremony was an evening affair with family and friends present. The bride was the center of attraction in her flowing white gown, while the groom appeared in a black tuxedo.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Following their nuptials, Guy and Angie relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where he continued pursuing his gospel music career.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Penrod family is close-knit, as the couple has frequently demonstrated their unconditional love for each other. Their union is listed as one of the most successful marriages in the music industry as the duo have successfully lived together as man and wife for 38 years and are still going strong.</span></p><p>The fact that their union is inching towards four decades does not mean that it has been totally devoid of matrimonial issues. In fact, Angie and Guy were rumored to be headed for the divorce court in May 2015, but all of a sudden, they rolled out a huge party for their 30th wedding anniversary.</p><h3><strong>How Many Children Does Guy Penrod Have?</strong></h3><p>Guy Penrod and his lifelong wife, Angie, have a large family. They are parents to eight children – seven boys and one girl. The boys in the Penrod brood include Grayson, Joe, Jesse, Levi, Taylor, Logan, and Zachariah.

Though the order of birth for the children is unknown, Lucy is said to be the baby of the family and was born in 2006, while the oldest is Tyler.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nothing is known about the personal and professional lives of the Penrod brood, but it is a known fact that they were all home-schooled. However, the oldest boy, Tyler, went to Liberty University like his music star dad; from what is obvious, he replicated Guy’s story in Liberty. Guy’s first son also met the woman who would become his wife as a student at the academic institution. Levy and Grayson also went to Liberty University.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tyler and his love interest, Ashley Marie Steffens, started dating immediately after they met, and in September 2015, they tied the marital knot. Who would be more eligible to officiate at their wedding than Guy himself, who is also a pastor? Guy took a lot of pride in joining Tyler and Ashley at the Tennessee-based Penrod family farm.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>One of his sons, Joe, is married to Kaitlin, and according to Guy’s Instagram handle, they are expecting a daughter.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Guy Penrod is not just a father of eight; the American gospel artist is also a grandfather to three grandchildren.

He generated a lot of income from selling his CDs, DVDs, royalties, and more.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Most of his songs and albums charted on the Billboard 100 several times. At a point in his career life, Penrod dabbled into TV hosting and recorded a few gigs as an actor.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Guy Penrod’s Early Career</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As earlier mentioned, Guy started his career as far back as his days as a student of Hobbs High School when he completed the production of his debut album. However, following his college graduation, he scored a job as a studio singer.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was also seen working as a backup vocalist to A-list singers such as Carman, Steve Green, Amy Grant, Garth Brooks, and Shania Twain. The gospel artist also worked with Michael W. Smith (this happened during the 1980s), James Ingram, and Phillips.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There was a time that Opryland employed him in 1987 when the singer performed for the Stamps Quartet.

His broad singing range and powerful voice made him a household name in the industry. Guy was the frontman when the Gaither Homecoming Records was at its peak, performing all over the United States and Canada.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The band equally put up successful performances in Europe, Africa, and Australia, further broadening the lead vocalist’s horizon. In 1999, Guy Penrod collaborated with Glen Payne (Cathedral Quartet’s lead singer) in a duet, which was later accomplished for the duo’s Farewell Celebration video.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In all, Guy recorded a total of 12 albums in association with Gaither Vocal Band before deciding to strive for greater heights in his music career.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Why Did Guy Penrod Leave Gaither Vocal Band?</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Guy’s reasons for opting to leave the Gaither Vocal Band were never specified, but many sources claim it was his passion for launching a solo career that led him to leave.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Penrod announced his exit from the band on the 13th of January 2009 and was replaced by Michael English and David Phelps; both vocalists also exited from the band at a point but later went back.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He went Solo in 2009</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Penrod went on to spend 15 long years with the famed Gaither Vocal Band, but in 2009,he decided to go solo. As the year rolled by, he had his nose to the grindstone, working on his debut solo album entitled Breathe Deep in collaboration with the Servant Records label. The album eventually hit the music stand in August 2008.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The album was well-received by fans and is listed as the production credit of Brent Rowan, a veteran studio musician and country music producer. This time, Guy shifted from gospel to infuse the album with some real country music, though a good number of the tracks came with Christian undertones.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With the level of fame he had achieved so far, it was no surprise that Guy Penrod became an inductee into the Texas Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2011.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Barely one year after his debut solo album hit the music stand, Guy dropped his second, Hymns, in 2012.

He is equally a winner of the GMA DOVE award; this happened during his time with Gaither Vocal Band. During the National Quartet Convention of 2013, Guy emerged as the winner of the Soloist of the Year award.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Guy Penrod is quite distinct from other musicians who go into the industry for fame and fortune alone.
