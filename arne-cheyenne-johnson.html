To the police, it was clear that the 40-year-old landlord had been killed by his tenant Arne Johnson during a violent argument.</p><p>But after his arrest, Arne Johnson made an incredible claim: The Devil made him do it. Aided by two paranormal investigators, the 19-year-old’s attorneys presented their client’s claim of demonic possession as a potential defense for his murder of Bono.</p><p>“The courts have dealt with the existence of God,” said Johnson’s attorney Martin Minnella. “Now they’re going to have to deal with the existence of the Devil.”</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288409 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ed-and-lorraine-warren-at-danbury-court.jpg alt="Ed And Lorraine Warren" width=900 height=620 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-288409 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren at Danbury Superior Court.

Nearly 40 years later, Arne Johnson’s case is still shrouded in controversy and unsettling speculation. It is also the inspiration for the film The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.</p><h2>Arne Johnson Before The “Devil Made Me Do It” Murder</h2><p>On February 16, 1981, Arne Cheyenne Johnson stabbed his landlord Alan Bono to death with a five-inch pocket knife, committing the first murder ever recorded in the 193-year history of Brookfield. Before the murder, Johnson was by all accounts a regular teenager with no criminal record.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288419 alt="Brookfield Connecticut" width=900 height=670 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/brookfield-connecticut-railroad-junction.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288419 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The murder of Alan Bono was the first ever recorded in Brookfield’s 193-year history.</span></p><p>But the strange occurrences that ended in the murder allegedly began months earlier. In Johnson’s courtroom defense, he claimed that the source of all this suffering started with the 11-year-old brother of his fiancée, Debbie Glatzel.</p><p>In the summer of 1980, Debbie’s brother David claimed that he’d repeatedly encountered an old man who would taunt him. At first, Johnson and Glatzel thought David was just trying to get out of doing chores, and dismissed the story entirely. Nonetheless, the encounters continued, growing both more frequent and more violent.</p><p>David would wake up crying hysterically, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">describing visions</a> of a “man with big black eyes, a thin face with animal features and jagged teeth, pointed ears, horns and hoofs.” Before long, the family asked a priest from a church nearby to bless their home — to no avail.</p><p>So they hoped that paranormal investigators <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ed and Lorraine Warren</a> could lend a hand.</p>An interview with Ed and Lorraine Warren about David Glatzel.<p>“He would kick, bite, spit, swear — terrible words,” David’s family members said of his possession. “He experienced strangling attempts by invisible hands, which he tried to pull from his neck, and powerful forces would flop him rapidly head-to-toe like a rag doll.”</p><p>Arne Johnson stayed with the family to help however he could. But disturbingly, the child’s nightly terrors began to seep into the daytime as well. David described seeing “an old man with a white beard, dressed in a flannel shirt and jeans.” And as the child’s visions continued, suspicious noises began emanating from the attic.</p><p>Meanwhile, David started hissing, having seizures, and speaking in strange voices while quoting John Milton’s Paradise Lost and the Bible.</p><p>Reviewing the case, the Warrens concluded that this was clearly a case of demonic possession. However, psychiatrists who investigated the case after the fact claimed that David merely had a learning disability.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288417 alt="The True Story Of The Conjuring 3" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/patrick-wilson-and-vera-farmiga.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288417 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Warner Bros. Pictures</span><span class=caption-body>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring series.</span></p><p>The Warrens claimed that over the course of three subsequent exorcisms —&nbsp;oversaw by priests — David levitated, cursed, and even stopped breathing. Perhaps even more astonishingly, David allegedly predicted the murder that Arne Cheyenne Johnson would eventually commit.</p><p>By October 1980, Arne Johnson started taunting the demonic presence, telling it to stop bothering his fiancée’s brother. “Take me on, leave my little buddy alone,” he cried.</p><h2>Arne Johnson’s Murder Of Alan Bono</h2><p>As a source of income, Arne Johnson worked for a tree surgeon. Meanwhile, Bono <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">managed a kennel</a>. The two were purportedly friendly and often met up near the kennel — with Johnson sometimes even calling in sick to work in order to do so.</p><p>But on Feb. 16, 1981, a vicious argument broke out between them. At around 6:30 p.m., Johnson suddenly drew out a pocket knife and attacked Bono.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288411 alt="The Devil Made Me Do It Trial" width=800 height=863 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arne-cheyenne-johnson-at-danbury-court.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288411 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Arne Cheyenne Johnson entering the courthouse in Danbury, Connecticut. March 19, 1981.</span></p><p>Bono was stabbed multiple times in the chest and stomach and then was left to bleed to death. Police arrested Johnson an hour later, and they said that the two men had simply been fighting over Johnson’s fiancée, Debbie. But the Warrens insisted there was more to the story.</p><p>At some point prior to the murder, Johnson had allegedly investigated a well in the same area where his fiancée’s brother claimed to experience his first encounter with the malicious presence wreaking havoc on their lives.</p><p>The Warrens warned Johnson not to go near the same well, but he did anyway, perhaps to see if the demons truly took over his body after he had taunted them. Johnson later claimed that he saw a demon hiding within the well, who possessed him until after the murder.</p><p>Though authorities investigated the Warrens’ claims of a haunting, they stuck with the story that Bono was simply killed during an altercation with Arne Johnson over his fiancée.</p><h2>“The Devil Made Me Do It”: The Trial Of Arne Cheyenne Johnson</h2><p>Arne Johnson’s attorney Martin Minnella tried his best to enter a plea of “not guilty by reason of demonic possession.” He even planned to subpoena the priests who allegedly attended the exorcisms, urging them to break tradition by speaking about their controversial rites.</p><p>Over the course of the trial, Minnella and the Warrens were routinely mocked by their peers, who saw them as profiteers of tragedy.</p><p>“They have an excellent vaudeville act, a good road show,” said mentalist George Kresge. “It’s just that this case more involves clinical psychologists than it does them.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288412 alt="Arne Johnson Exiting Police Van" width=600 height=871 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arne-cheyenne-johnson-exiting-police-van.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288412 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Arne Cheyenne Johnson exiting a police van after arriving at court. His case would later inspire The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. March 19, 1981.</span></p><p>Judge Robert Callahan ultimately rejected Minnella’s plea. Judge Callahan argued such a defense would be impossible to prove, and that any testimony on the matter was unscientific and thus irrelevant.</p><p>The collaboration of four priests during the three exorcisms was never confirmed, but the Diocese of Bridgeport acknowledged that priests worked on helping David Glatzel during a difficult time. The priests in question, meanwhile, were ordered not to speak on the matter publicly.</p><p>“No one from the church has said one way or the other what was involved,” said Rev. Nicholas V. Grieco, a diocese spokesman. “And we decline to say.”</p><p>But Johnson’s lawyers were permitted to examine Bono’s clothing. The lack of any blood, rips, or tears, they argued, could help support the claim of demonic involvement. However, no one in the court was convinced.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288406 alt="Arne Cheyenne Johnson Sketch" width=600 height=468 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arne-cheyenne-johnson-sketch.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288406 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>UVA School of Law Archives</span><span class=caption-body>A courtroom sketch of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, whose trial inspired The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.</span></p><p>So Johnson’s legal team opted for a self-defense plea. Ultimately, Arne Johnson was convicted of first-degree manslaughter on November 24, 1981 and sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison. He only served about five.</p><h2>How This Story Inspired The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It</h2><p>As Arne Johnson languished behind bars, Gerald Brittle’s book about the incident, The Devil in Connecticut, was published with help from Lorraine Warren. On top of that, the trial also inspired the production of a television movie called The Demon Murder Case.</p><p>David Glatzel’s brother Carl was not amused. He ended up suing Brittle and Warren for the book, alleging that it violated his right to privacy. He also said that it was an “intentional affliction of emotional distress.” Further, he claimed the narrative was a hoax <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created by the Warrens</a>, who took advantage of his brother’s mental health for money.</p><p>After serving about five years in prison, Johnson was released in 1986. He married his fiancée while he was still behind bars, and as of 2014, they were still together.</p><p>As for Debbie, she maintains an interest in the supernatural and claims that Arne’s biggest mistake was challenging “the beast” that possessed her younger brother.</p><p>“You never take that step,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>. “You never challenge the Devil. Arne started showing the same signs my brother did when he was under possession.”</p><p>Most recently, Arne Johnson’s case was featured as <a href=# rel=noopener>the true story behind The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It</a> — but the real-life tale remains even more disturbing to this day.</p><p>After learning about the trial of Arne Johnson that inspired The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, read about other <a href=#>real-life stories behind the </a>Conjuring movies and the infamous Conjuring house.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyivs2eZJygla6yr7rEZqGooJ6ovK8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-andrew-darnell-4835790.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Andrew Darnell? 5 Things About Man Spending Time With Madonna Hollywood Life</a>
