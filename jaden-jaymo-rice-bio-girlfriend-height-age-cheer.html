He is making his debut in Netflix’s ‘Cheer’ season 2 and earning recognition on his right who was previously known as Angel Rice’s brother. This article discusses his girlfriend, height, and his age.</p><p>Delve into this Jaden “Jaymo” Rice article to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice On Netlix’s Cheer Season 2</strong></h3><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice is a member of the rival team Trinity Valley Community College who is ready to challenge their rival team and last year’s champion Navarro College. Jaymo tumbles alongside his star sister Angel Rice at TVCC. He has grown close with Johnson and Ben his two teammates.</p><p>He is appearing alongside his co-stars <a href=#>Jada Wooten</a>, a second-year tumbler and flyer, Jeron Hazelwood, TVCC’s star stunter and tumbler, Devonte ‘Dee’ Joseph, one of TVCC’s new tumblers who can successfully pull off a “quint” that is so difficult it’s illegal to perform at Daytona, <a href=#>Angel Rice</a>, a Guinness Book of World Records holder for most double full twists and a former member of Team USA gymnastics, and Ben “Benji” Chester who is known for his flexibility. With all the star cheer, TVCC’s team looked formidable team this year.</p><p>Jaden announced the premiere of Netflix’s show on his IG. He shared his excitement for the world to get to know his team that captioned the post, “<a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#CheerSeason2</a>&nbsp;premiers January 12 on&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@netflix</a>.

Most of his social media posts are of him practicing his craft so there is not much that we know about his girlfriend. Jaden could be dating someone and is in a relationship but unlike his other team members, he avoids flaunting his relationship on social media platforms.</p><p>Hence, his private nature made it quite impossible to answer the question of whether he is single or in a relationship. But, the fact that Jaden is absolutely lowkey on that part of his life, we believe that he is single until he proclaims his dating life to the world.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Jaden “Jaymo” Rice?</strong></h3><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice turned 19 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Height</strong></h3><p>Talking about his height, Jaden “Jaymo” stands tall under 6 feet.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Career</strong></h3><p>Jaden had previously cheered for the Stingray Allstars. In May 2018, he had announced making it on the Stingray All-Stars team with an IG post, “Your boy just made Steel again <a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#steelrays</a><a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#imaderays</a>“.</p><p>Back in 2016, Jaden had won the Spirit of Hope Cheer competition organized at Charlotte Convention Center. Whereas, Stingrays had secured third place in the World in 2018. He captioned, “3rd place in the World not so bad for my 1st year”.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice celebrates his birthday on 14 August every year.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Who Are Jaden “Jaymo” Rice’s Parents And Siblings?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice was born to his father Bennie R Rice and his mother Tonyona Ebony Olriedge.</p><p>His father attended Druid Hills High School and is also available on Facebook (@bennie.r.rice).
